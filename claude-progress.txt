=== VaultBox Progress ===
Last updated: 2026-02-09
Last completed feature: F4 — AuthService
Current status: compiles, 21 tests passing
Next feature: F5 — PINKeypadView + PINSetupView
Blockers: none
Notes: AuthService is @MainActor class (not actor) because ModelContext isn't Sendable. KeyStorage protocol enables InMemoryKeyStorage for tests. Use @preconcurrency import for KeychainAccess. Use 'iPhone 17 Pro' simulator.
