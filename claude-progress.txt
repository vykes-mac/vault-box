=== VaultBox Progress ===
Last updated: 2026-02-09
Last completed feature: F40 — Final build validation
Current status: compiles, all tests passing, 0 warnings
Next feature: NONE — All features F0-F40 complete
Blockers: none
Notes: F30-F40 implemented in one batch. CameraView uses AVFoundation with AVCaptureSession for direct-to-vault capture (no Camera Roll). EmptyStateView reusable component wired to vault grid, album grid, and break-in log. Haptics.swift provides @MainActor enum with light/medium/heavy impact and success/error notifications wired to PIN entry, selection, delete, purchase. Animation polish already existed from prior sessions (PIN shake/green). Rate prompt uses SKStoreReviewController after 10th import tracked via AppSettings.importCount. PremiumBadge/VaultItemThumbnail/AlbumCoverView reusable components created. View+ConditionalModifier and Data+Encryption extensions added. VaultBoxError enum covers all PRD Appendix B error cases. Theme support via System/Light/Dark picker in settings with NotificationCenter propagation. Privacy policy, terms, restore purchases, and version display already in SettingsView from F20. F40 final validation: clean build 0 errors 0 warnings, all tests pass, portrait lock confirmed, all Info.plist keys present.
