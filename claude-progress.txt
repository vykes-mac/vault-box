=== VaultBox Progress ===
Last updated: 2026-02-08
Last completed feature: F3 — EncryptionService
Current status: compiles, 10 tests passing
Next feature: F4 — AuthService
Blockers: none
Notes: Keychain doesn't work in test host — use encryptData(_:using:) overloads for testing. Info.plist now has CFBundleExecutable and other required keys. Use 'iPhone 17 Pro' simulator.
