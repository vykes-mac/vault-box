=== VaultBox Progress ===
Last updated: 2026-02-09
Last completed feature: F29 — BackupSettingsView
Current status: compiles, all tests passing
Next feature: F30 — Built-in camera (direct-to-vault capture)
Blockers: none
Notes: F20-F29 implemented in one batch. SettingsView has all PRD sections (Security, Appearance, Backup, Privacy, Storage, About). Decoy mode hides Security/Appearance/Backup/Privacy sections. SecuritySettingsView handles PIN change and decoy PIN setup with 3-step flow (verify current → enter new → confirm). BreakInService captures front camera photo + GPS on failed attempts with auto-purge at 20. BreakInLogView shows masked PINs and MapKit detail. CloudService uses CloudUploadPayload struct to avoid Sendable issues with VaultItem across actor boundaries. PanicGestureService uses CMMotionManager face-down detection (z gravity > 0.9). AppIconService defines 8 alternate icons with system image placeholders (actual icon assets need to be added to Assets.xcassets for real deployment). AlbumGridView and VaultGridView now filter by isDecoyMode for decoy vault isolation. SettingsViewModel manages settings state with modelContext-based persistence. PaywallView not duplicated — reuses VaultBoxPaywallView (RevenueCatUI) from F18.
