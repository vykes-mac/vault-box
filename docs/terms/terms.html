    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 11, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> VaultBox is a photo and video vault app. You own
      your content. We encrypt it on your device. You are responsible for
      remembering your PIN. These terms govern your use of the app and any paid
      subscriptions.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By downloading, installing, or using VaultBox ("the App"), you agree to be
      bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). The App is provided by Pack6
      LLC ("we," "us," "our"), a company registered in Jamaica. If you do not
      agree to these Terms, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
      VaultBox is a mobile application for iOS that allows you to store photos,
      videos, and documents in an encrypted vault protected by a personal
      identification number (PIN) and optional biometric authentication. The App
      offers both free and premium subscription features.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 17 years old to use VaultBox. By using the App, you
      represent that you meet this age requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Your Account & Security</h2>
    <p>
      When you set up VaultBox, you create a PIN that protects access to your
      vault. You are solely responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing a secure PIN and keeping it confidential</li>
      <li>
        Remembering your PIN — we cannot recover, reset, or bypass your PIN
        under any circumstances
      </li>
      <li>Maintaining the security of your device</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Important:</strong> If you forget your PIN, you will permanently
      lose access to all content stored in VaultBox. Because your data is
      encrypted with a key derived from your PIN, there is no recovery
      mechanism, no backdoor, and no way for Pack6 LLC to help you regain
      access. This is by design for your security.
    </div>

    <h2>5. Your Content</h2>
    <p>
      You retain full ownership of all photos, videos, documents, and other
      content you store in VaultBox ("Your Content"). We do not claim any rights
      to Your Content. Because all content is encrypted on your device, we do
      not have the ability to access, view, or use Your Content.
    </p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The legality of the content you store in VaultBox</li>
      <li>Maintaining backups of content that is important to you</li>
      <li>
        Any consequences of deleting content from your Camera Roll after
        importing it to VaultBox
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use VaultBox to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Store, distribute, or facilitate access to content that is illegal under
        the laws of your jurisdiction
      </li>
      <li>Store content that depicts the exploitation or abuse of minors</li>
      <li>
        Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App's
        encryption or security mechanisms
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the App in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement agencies if
      required by law. However, because we do not have access to your encrypted
      content, any such cooperation is limited to information we actually
      possess, which does not include Your Content.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>

      <strong>Free Tier:</strong> VaultBox offers a free tier with limited
      features, including storage of up to 50 items.

      <li>
        Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase
      </li>
      <li>
        Your subscription automatically renews unless you turn off auto-renewal
        at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period
      </li>
      <li>
        Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the
        end of the current period at the then-current subscription rate
      </li>
      <li>
        You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal in your Apple
        ID Account Settings
      </li>
      <li>
        Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited
        when you purchase a subscription
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Refunds:</strong> All purchases are processed by Apple. Refund
      requests must be submitted to Apple directly through their support
      channels. We do not have the ability to process refunds.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Price Changes:</strong> We may change subscription prices at any
      time. Price changes will not affect your current billing period. You will
      be notified of any price change before your next renewal.
    </p>

    <h2>8. iCloud Backup</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable the iCloud backup feature (available to Premium
      subscribers), your encrypted vault data will be stored in your personal
      iCloud account. You acknowledge that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        iCloud storage is governed by Apple's terms and conditions, not by these
        Terms
      </li>
      <li>
        Your iCloud storage limits and availability are determined by Apple and
        your iCloud plan
      </li>
      <li>
        We are not responsible for data loss resulting from iCloud service
        disruptions, iCloud storage limits, or changes to your Apple ID
      </li>
      <li>
        Disabling iCloud backup does not delete previously uploaded data — you
        must manage your iCloud storage directly through your device settings
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Data Loss & Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      While we have designed VaultBox to securely store your content, we cannot
      guarantee against all forms of data loss. You acknowledge and agree that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We are not responsible for data loss caused by device failure, software
        errors, operating system updates, accidental deletion, forgotten PINs,
        or any other cause
      </li>
      <li>
        You are responsible for maintaining independent backups of any content
        that is important to you
      </li>
      <li>
        Deleting photos from your Camera Roll after importing them into VaultBox
        means VaultBox becomes the sole copy — we are not liable if that copy is
        lost
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The VaultBox app, including its design, code, graphics, and brand
      identity, is the intellectual property of Pack6 LLC. You are granted a
      limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for your
      personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and the Apple
      App Store terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      VaultBox is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the
      fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Pack6 LLC disclaims all
      warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied
      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
      non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted,
      error-free, or completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Pack6 LLC shall not be
      liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
      damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or
      loss of privacy, arising out of or related to your use of VaultBox,
      regardless of the theory of liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no event shall Pack6 LLC's total cumulative liability exceed the amount
      you have paid for VaultBox Premium in the twelve (12) months preceding the
      event giving rise to the claim.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pack6 LLC, its officers,
      directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or
      expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use of the
      App, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any applicable
      laws.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using VaultBox at any time by deleting the App from your
      device. We may terminate or suspend your access to the App if you violate
      these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the App ends. Sections
      5, 9, 11, 12, and 13 survive termination.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
      of Jamaica, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes
      arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
      of the courts of Jamaica.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes,
      we will update the effective date at the top of this page and notify users
      through an in-app notice. Your continued use of VaultBox after changes are
      posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Severability</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
      that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
      necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
      effect.
    </p>

    <h2>18. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire
      agreement between you and Pack6 LLC regarding your use of VaultBox and
      supersede any prior agreements.
