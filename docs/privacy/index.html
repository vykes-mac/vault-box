    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 12, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>The short version:</strong> VaultBox encrypts your photos and
      videos on your device. We cannot see, access, or read your content. We
      collect no personal data. Your privacy is not just a feature — it is the
      entire product.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      VaultBox is developed and operated by <strong>Pack6 LLC</strong>, a
      company registered in Jamaica. In this policy, "we," "us," and "our" refer
      to Pack6 LLC.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We designed VaultBox to collect as little data as possible. Here is a
      complete and honest breakdown:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data we DO NOT collect:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your photos, videos, or documents — all content is encrypted on your
        device and never transmitted to our servers
      </li>
      <li>
        Your PIN, recovery code, or biometric data — your PIN and recovery code
        are processed locally, only protected representations are stored on your
        device, and none of this leaves your device
      </li>
      <li>Your name, email address, or phone number</li>
      <li>
        Your location (location is only used locally for break-in alerts and is
        never sent to us)
      </li>
      <li>Browsing history, contacts, messages, or any other personal data</li>
      <li>Analytics, device fingerprints, or advertising identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Data that may be collected by third parties:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple (App Store & iCloud):</strong> If you purchase a
        subscription, Apple processes the transaction. We receive a record that
        a purchase was made but we do not receive your payment details, Apple
        ID, or name. If you enable iCloud backup within VaultBox, your encrypted
        data is stored in your personal iCloud account — we have no access to
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions.
        RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID and purchase transaction
        data from Apple. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or any
        content from your vault. You can review RevenueCat's privacy policy at
        <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How Your Data Is Protected</h2>
    <p>
      Every photo, video, and document you store in VaultBox is encrypted using
      AES-256-GCM encryption via Apple's CryptoKit framework before it is saved
      to your device. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your content is encrypted at rest on your device at all times</li>
      <li>
        If you enable iCloud backup, only the already-encrypted data is uploaded
        to your personal iCloud account — we never see the unencrypted content
      </li>
      <li>
        Your PIN is never stored in plaintext — it is hashed with a random salt
        using a one-way cryptographic function
      </li>
      <li>
        Recovery codes are stored only as one-way hashed values with salt on
        your device; we cannot retrieve your original recovery code
      </li>
      <li>
        Biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) is handled entirely by iOS
        — we never receive or store biometric data
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. iCloud Backup</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to enable iCloud backup (a premium feature), your encrypted
      vault data is stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's
      CloudKit private database. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The data is associated with your Apple ID, not with us</li>
      <li>We cannot access, read, or decrypt your iCloud backup</li>
      <li>
        You can delete your iCloud backup at any time through your device's
        iCloud storage settings
      </li>
      <li>
        Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy govern the storage of this data
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Break-In Detection</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable break-in alerts, VaultBox may capture a photo using the
      front-facing camera and record the device's approximate location when an
      incorrect PIN is entered multiple times. This data is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stored locally on your device only, encrypted like all other vault
        content
      </li>
      <li>Never transmitted to us or any third party</li>
      <li>
        Fully under your control — you can view, delete, or disable this feature
        at any time in Settings
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      VaultBox is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. We do not
      knowingly collect any information from children. The app is rated 16+ on
      the App Store.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      VaultBox does not include any advertising SDKs, analytics trackers, or
      social media integrations. The only third-party service used is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat</strong> — for subscription management only. No
        personal data is shared with RevenueCat beyond anonymous transaction
        records.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect your data, there is nothing for us to retain or
      delete. All vault content exists solely on your device (and optionally in
      your personal iCloud account). To delete all VaultBox data, simply delete
      the app from your device and, if applicable, remove VaultBox data from
      your iCloud storage.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Because we do not collect personal data, most data-rights regulations
      (such as GDPR or CCPA) do not apply in the traditional sense. However, you
      always have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Delete all your data by removing the app and its associated iCloud data
      </li>
      <li>
        Disable any optional feature (break-in alerts, iCloud backup) at any
        time
      </li>
      <li>Contact us with any privacy questions or concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we will update the
      effective date at the top of this page and notify users through an in-app
      notice. Continued use of VaultBox after changes are posted constitutes
      acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
